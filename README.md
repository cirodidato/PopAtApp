##Features
Set multiple alarms with customizable times.
Wake up by completing a "mission" (e.g., answer correctly to pre-set questions).
Sleek, minimalist design inspired by Apple's native Clock app.
Notifications with sound, even when the app is in the background.

##Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone <https://github.com/cirodidato/PopAtApp/tree/main>  
Open the project in Xcode.
Ensure your simulator or connected device is running iOS 15.0 or later.
Build and run the app.

##How It Works
Navigate to the Home screen to view and manage alarms.
Add a new alarm, set the time, and customize the mission.
When the alarm rings, complete the mission to turn it off and jumpstart your day!
